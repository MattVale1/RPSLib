# RPS.dll:
Named after my game studio alias, Red Phoenix Studios. A growing collection of common code that is used throughout all of my Unity projects. The idea is to:
- Save time re-writing the same code for each project.
- Provide optimized code for common operations, aiding in high performance for runtime.
- Provide easy to use methods for more complex algorithms.

# RPSLib.unitypackage:
This Unity package is also included in this repo and is all you need to use this library. It contains various scripts, prefabs, render pipeline configs, UI elements, a splash scene and more. Some systems included are inventory management, itemisation and ScriptableObject based quests.

⚠️ The Red Phoenix Studios logo included in the Unity package is **NOT** for reuse or modification.

# Third-party packages included:

- The free edition of [LeanTween](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/animation/leantween-3595) by [dentedpixel](https://github.com/dentedpixel/LeanTween). For all kinds of tweening animations.
- [Steamworks](https://steamworks.github.io/gettingstarted/) by [Riley Labrecque](https://github.com/rlabrecque/Steamworks.NET). A C# wrapper for  the Steamworks API.

# Installation:
Head to [Releases](https://github.com/matthewvale/RPSLib/releases) and grab the files you need.

- **(DLL-only)** Install `RPS.dll` and `RPS.xml` by dropping the file into your project. Ideally in it's own unique folder. Simple!
- **(Unity Package)** Install the RPSLib package by dropping `RPSLib.unitypackage` into your project. The package will always contain the latest `RPS.dll`, so no need to grab them if yo use the package, nor build the project unless you edit the source files. If you do edit the source and make a build, copy the `RPS.dll` and `RPS.xml` into your project, overriding the existing files.

**Dependencies:**
- Steamworks.NET (included in RPSLib.unitypackage)
- Unity Localization package (please fetch this yourself)

# Usage:
Within your code, you can access the DLL by simply typing `RPSLib.` and then the class you require, or by importing RPS at the top of your file with `using RPSLib;`.
### Examples:
```
// Returns a GameObject at the mouse position.
clickedObject = RPSLib.Physics.Raycast.GetGameObjectAtMousePosition(rayDistance, buildingMask, mainCamera);

// Returns a float value representing the distance between 2 objects, using square magnitude.
inspectedDistance = RPSLib.Maths.Distances.GetFastDistance(fromPos, toPos);

// If we loaded the current scene Additively, go back to the previous scene and set it as the active scene.
RPSLib.SceneManagement.NavigateSceneBack(true);

// Take a screenshot with some optional params (file name, include DateTime, hide UI, file extension and debug logging.
RPSLib.ScreenshotHandler.TakeScreenshot("Screenshot", true, true, RPSLib.ScreenshotHandler.FileExtension.PNG, true);
```
