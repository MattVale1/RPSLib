**What's This?**

A (currently) small collection of common code that is used throughout all of my Unity projects. The idea is to:
- Save time re-writing the same code each project or in various classes.
- Provide optimized code for common operations, aiding in high performance for runtime.
- Provide easy to use methods for more complex algorithms.

Most of the classes are currently Utility classes; Commonly used code that can be accessed from anywhere in your project.

**Installation:**

Create a release build of the project, this will produce an RPS.dll file.
You can simply copy/paste this file into your Unity project.

**Usage:**

Within your code, you can access the DLL by simply ryping "RPS." and then the class you require.
